# SharedFault : Sensitivity analysis of shared variable in approximate multithreaded programs.

This project is to study the effect of synchronization of shared variables with respect to the QoS of the application. The following
workflow to use the tool:-

## Ideas
 - Test the shared variable individually like Autosense
 - Test simultaneously all shared variables using Entropy approach
In both of the above approachs we need to know in advance whether a variable is shared by multiple threads. Todo that we need 
`shared variable discovery`

1. Shared Variable discovery. 
    

2. Fault injection using various statistical method ( Example SPRT).


## Fault model implementation using LLVM IR code transformation

The basic idea is 

### Investigating on application : Convolution 2D of an image
